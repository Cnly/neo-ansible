Currently, this directory needs to contain the following files:
- **nss**. This should be an executable file compiled for the target local machine using the source from [neoserverselector](https://github.com/cnly/neoserverselector).
- **v2ray.zip**. This should be a distribution zip file obtained from the v2ray [release](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/releases) page, renamed to `v2ray.zip`.
